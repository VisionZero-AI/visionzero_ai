📘 VisionZero AI — Overview
Predictive Crash-Risk Mapping & Road Safety Intelligence

VisionZero AI is a geospatial intelligence platform that identifies high-risk crash locations and helps cities make proactive, data-driven road-safety decisions.
It combines historical crash data, roadway structure, and machine-learning models to produce:

Hotspot maps

Risk corridors

Severity-weighted priority zones

Engineering + enforcement recommendations

VisionZero AI supports Vision Zero, Safe Streets for All (SS4A), and city planning departments by giving them clear, actionable insights.

🧩 Why VisionZero AI?

City traffic teams often face:

Limited analytical staff

Slow GIS workflows

Reactive decision-making

Fragmented crash data

Difficulty identifying long-term patterns

VisionZero AI solves this using automated processing, ML scoring, and corridor-level analytics.
