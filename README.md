# 🛣️ VisionZero AI  
### Predictive Crash-Risk Mapping & Road Safety Intelligence  
**By VisionZero AI — Data-Driven Road Safety for Cities**

---

## 📘 Overview

**VisionZero AI** is a geospatial intelligence platform that predicts **high-risk crash locations** and helps cities prioritize:

- Enforcement & patrol routes  
- Engineering upgrades (signals, crossings, traffic calming)  
- Public awareness campaigns  
- Emergency response planning  

The system ingests **public crash data, roadway structure, and contextual features**, then produces **risk corridors and hotspots** that can be viewed on interactive maps or integrated into city dashboards.

This repository is a **public-facing demo and documentation hub**.  
All production-grade models, pipelines, and engines remain **private**.

## 🌍 Current Focus Areas

- **Pittsburgh, PA (USA)** – Crash-risk density maps & hotspot analysis  
- **San José, CA (USA)** – Corridor-level predictive risk mapping  
- **FlashFlood AI Integration** – Shared concepts between crash and flood risk for Smart City AI

## ⭐ Key Public Features

### 🔹 Crash Risk Hotspot Maps  
Shows where severe crashes are historically concentrated and how risk shifts with:

- Time of day  
- Day of week  
- Seasonality

### 🔹 Predictive Risk Corridors (Conceptual)  
Explains how corridor-level risk is modeled using:

- Crash history  
- Road geometry  
- Speed environment  
- Proximity to intersections, schools, transit, etc.

### 🔹 Methodology Notes (High-Level)  
Non-sensitive description of:

- Use of standard ML techniques (e.g., gradient-boosted trees)  
- PostGIS / geospatial feature engineering  
- Aggregation to road segments and corridors  
- How risk scores can be turned into policy actions

### 🔹 Civic Use Cases  
Examples of how cities might use VisionZero AI:

- Prioritize traffic calming projects  
- Support Vision Zero / road-safety strategies  
- Inform grant applications and safety plans  
- Strengthen collaboration between planners, engineers, police, and EM.
