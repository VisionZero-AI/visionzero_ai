📘 VisionZero AI — Overview
Predictive Crash-Risk Mapping & Road Safety Intelligence

VisionZero AI is a geospatial intelligence platform that identifies high-risk crash locations and helps cities make proactive, data-driven road-safety decisions.
It combines historical crash data, roadway structure, and machine-learning models to produce:

Hotspot maps

Risk corridors

Severity-weighted priority zones

Engineering + enforcement recommendations

VisionZero AI’s mission is to support Vision Zero, Safe Streets for All (SS4A), and city planning departments by giving them clear, actionable insights.

🧩 Why VisionZero AI?

City traffic teams often face:

Limited analytical staff

Slow, manual GIS processes

Reactive decision-making

Fragmented crash datasets

Difficulty identifying long-term risk patterns

VisionZero AI solves this through:

Automated data ingestion

Predictive ML scoring

Corridor-level risk modeling

Visual maps for planners and policymakers

Integration into existing GIS workflows

🗺️ Current Focus Cities
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

Crash-risk heatmaps

Severity weighting

Behavioral factor analysis (speeding, DUI, night-time, etc.)

San José, California

Predictive corridor modeling

High-resolution feature engineering

Integration with Innovation Hub pilot framework

🔍 What VisionZero AI Does (Public Summary)

Aggregates crashes into road segments and corridors

Computes risk using severity, geometry, speed environment, and temporal patterns

Produces hotspots, priority corridors, and risk layers

Generates action guidance for:

Signal improvements

Road diet opportunities

Enforcement routes

Safe routes to school analysis

This public repo summarizes the concepts, not the private engine.

🛠️ What’s Included in This Repo

This repository contains:

Public conceptual documentation

High-level methodology

Demo notebooks (safe versions)

City examples (Pittsburgh, San José)

Static images and public demo data

🔐 What’s NOT Included (Proprietary)

To protect IP, the following are not part of this public repo:

PostGIS schemas

Feature engineering pipelines

Model training code

Real model weights

Non-public city datasets

Smart City AI Engine backend code

Predictive flood / crash integration engine

These are stored privately in the smartcity-ai-engine repo.

🌆 Vision & Mission

VisionZero AI supports cities that want to:

Reduce severe and fatal crashes

Make safety decisions data-driven

Modernize their transportation analytics

Integrate predictive intelligence into long-term planning

Build safer streets for all road users
